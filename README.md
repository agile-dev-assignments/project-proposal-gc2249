# Gigify

## What?
**Gigify** is an app that helps musicians find gigs, and conversely, helps business owners find cheap quality entertainment for their businesses, be it bars, restaurants or other venues.

## Who?
This software is for aspiring musicians, small business owners, or anyone who is involved in a local music scene.

## How?
The user logs in to one of three types of user profiles: musician, business or audience. Musicians can post information about themselves like who they are, what kind of music they play and what is the price range for booking them. They can also post their music and videos. Similarly, business owners can specify what kind of music they are looking for and what are the prices they are willing to pay for booking them. Finally, an audience user can follow different musicians and businesses, keep up to date with where their favorite musicians are playing or who will play in their favorite bar. Musicians and businesses would be able to rate and comment on their experiences with each other, and audience users can rate and comment on both. 

## Scope
I think this project is challenging enough as it involves the interaction of different kinds of users on a social medium, however, it should not be impossible as the features it would have are very common on many different applications. Also, I think the scope of the app could very a lot, so we can build a very barebones working app and keep adding more features as time and our abilities allow us.
